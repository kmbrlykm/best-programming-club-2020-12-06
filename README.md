## Assignment

Open `index.html` in your default browser by double-clicking the file. Keep your [browser console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Browser_Console) open so that you can view console logs.

Part 1: Update the cart total by changing the lines inside the `initializeCartWithCount` function.

Part 2 (optional): Once complete, try the same thing using the `initializeCartWithList` function.

## Getting the assignment

You can pull down the assignment in one of 2 ways:

1. **Using a new repo:** [Fork this repo](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) and then clone it. You should now have an exact copy of this repo, linked to your GitHub account, and can commit and push to the repo.
2. **Using an existing repo:** Open the [index.html](./index.html) file in GitHub and copy the code. Create a new file in your existing repository and paste in the code. Commit and push to your repo.

Make sure to commit your changes as you're making progress on the assignment. You'll receive feedback on the commit messages. Remember, commit messages should be short and sweet, in present-tense with an imperative tone. For example:

```
rename cart variable
```

(Tip: If you're completing both parts of the assignment, create a minimum of 2 commits, one for each assignment.)
